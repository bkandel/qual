	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel supervised manifold learning technique called Supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps {(S-LE)}, which makes use of class label information to guide the procedure of non-linear dimensionality reduction by adopting the large margin concept. The graph Laplacian is split into two components: within-class graph and between-class graph to better characterize the discriminant property of the data. Our approach has two important characteristics: (i) it adaptively estimates the local neighborhood surrounding each sample based on data density and similarity and (ii) the objective function simultaneously maximizes the local margin between heterogeneous samples and pushes the homogeneous samples closer to each other. Our approach has been tested on several challenging face databases and it has been conveniently compared with other linear and non-linear techniques, demonstrating its superiority. Although we have concentrated in this paper on the face recognition problem, the proposed approach could also be applied to other category of objects characterized by large variations in their appearance (such as hand or body pose, for instance). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Graphs are formed that represent the connectivity of voxel segments in the foreground and background of the image. These graphs are analyzed and minimal corrections to the volume are made prior to tessellation. We apply the algorithm to a simple test object and to cerebral white matter masks generated by a low-level tissue identification sequence. We tessellate the resulting objects using the marching cubes algorithm and verify their topology by computing their Euler characteristics. A key benefit of the algorithm is that it localizes the change to a volume to the specific areas of its topological defects.},

Inspired by the idea of multi-view dimensionality reduction in machine learning community, two different kinds of tensor decomposition and their implications are presented.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To develop an automatic atlas-based method for segmentation of fiber bundles using High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging {(HARDI)} data.


{HYPOTHESIS}

Quantitative evaluation of diffusion characteristics inside specific fiber bundles provides new insights into disease developments, evolutions, therapy effects, and surgical interventions.


{BACKGROUND}

Most of previous segmentation methods use similarity measures and strategies that do not lead to accurate segmentation results. They also suffer from subjectivity of initial seeds and regions of interest {(ROI)} defined by operator.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

We propose a novel method that uses Spherical Harmonic Coefficients {(SHC)} of {HARDI} diffusion signals to compute Orientation Distribution Function {(ODF)} and to extract Principal Diffusion Directions {(PDDs).} The proposed method selects most collinear {PDD} of neighbors of each voxel. Then, based on {SHC} and selected {PDD}, a similarity measure is proposed and used as a speed function in the level set framework that segments fiber bundles. To automate the process, an atlas-based method is used to select initial seeds for fiber bundles. To generate data for evaluation of the proposed method, an artificial pattern consisting of three crossing bundles intersected by a circular bundle is created. Also, two normal controls are imaged by two different {HARDI} protocols.


{RESULTS}

Segmentation results for different fiber bundles in simulated data and normal control data are presented. Influence of threshold selection on the proposed segmentation method is evaluated using Dice coefficient. Also, effect of increasing the number of gradient directions on accuracy of extracted {PDDs} is evaluated.


{CONCLUSION}

The proposed segmentation method has advantages over previous methods especially those that use similarity measures based on diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} data. These advantages are achieved by proper propagation of a hyper-surface in fiber crossing areas without making assumptions about diffusivity profile and selection of initial seeds or {ROI.}},

By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, {LLE} is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

The functional correlates of the structural changes detected using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and voxel-based morphometry have not been extensively studied. A group of 25 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was compared to healthy control subjects using a multi-modal neuroimaging approach comprising T(1)-weighted, diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using probabilistic tractography, a grey matter connection network was defined based upon the prominent corticospinal tract and corpus callosum involvement demonstrated by white matter tract-based spatial statistics. This 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-specific' network included motor, premotor and supplementary motor cortices, pars opercularis and motor-related thalamic nuclei. A novel analysis protocol, using this disease-specific grey matter network as an input for a dual-regression analysis, was then used to assess changes in functional connectivity directly associated with this network. A spatial pattern of increased functional connectivity spanning sensorimotor, premotor, prefrontal and thalamic regions was found. A composite of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures also allowed the qualitative discrimination of patients from controls. An integrated structural and functional connectivity approach therefore identified apparently dichotomous processes characterizing the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cerebral network failure, in which there was increased functional connectivity within regions of decreased structural connectivity. Patients with slower rates of disease progression showed connectivity measures with values closer to healthy controls, raising the possibility that functional connectivity increases might not simply represent a physiological compensation to reduced structural integrity. One alternative possibility is that increased functional connectivity reflects a progressive loss of inhibitory cortical influence as part of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathogenesis, which might then have relevance to future therapeutic strategies.},

Although white matter tractography and eigenvector color maps provide visually appealing displays of white matter tract organization, they do not easily lend themselves to quantitative and statistical analysis. In this study, a set of visual and quantitative tools for the investigation of tensor orientations in the human brain was developed. Visual tools included rose diagrams, which are spherical coordinate histograms of the major eigenvector directions, and {3D} scatterplots of the major eigenvector angles. A scatter matrix of major eigenvector directions was used to describe the distribution of major eigenvectors in a defined anatomic region. A measure of eigenvector dispersion was developed to describe the degree of eigenvector coherence in the selected region. These tools were used to evaluate directional organization and the interhemispheric symmetry of {DT-MRI} data in five healthy human brains and two patients with infiltrative diseases of the white matter tracts. In normal anatomical white matter tracts, a high degree of directional coherence and interhemispheric symmetry was observed. The infiltrative diseases appeared to alter the eigenvector properties of affected white matter tracts, showing decreased eigenvector coherence and interhemispheric symmetry. This novel approach distills the rich, {3D} information available from the diffusion tensor into a form that lends itself to quantitative analysis and statistical hypothesis testing.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel segmentation-based approach for fiber-tract extraction in diffusion-tensor {(DT)} images. Typical tractography methods, incorporating thresholds on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking, can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise. For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts with sharp changes in orientation, e.g. the cingulum. Unlike tractography--which disregards the information in the tensors that were previously tracked--the proposed method extracts the cingulum by exploiting the statistical coherence of tensors in the entire structure. Moreover, the proposed segmentation-based method allows fuzzy class memberships to optimally extract information within partial-volumed voxels. Unlike typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes employing Gaussian models that are biased towards ellipsoidal clusters, the proposed method models the manifolds underlying the classes by incorporating nonparametric data-driven statistical models. Furthermore, it exploits the nonparametric model to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle. The results on real {DT} images demonstrate that the proposed method extracts the cingulum bundle significantly more accurately as compared to tractography.},

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis {(PCA)} and multidimensional scaling {(MDS)}, our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

	abstract = {Owning to its clinical accessibility, T1-weighted {MRI} {(Magnetic} Resonance Imaging) has been extensively studied in the past decades for prediction of Alzheimer's disease {(AD)} and mild cognitive impairment {(MCI).} The volumes of gray matter {(GM)}, white matter {(WM)} and cerebrospinal fluid {(CSF)} are the most commonly used measurements, resulting in many successful applications. It has been widely observed that disease-induced structural changes may not occur at isolated spots, but in several inter-related regions. Therefore, for better characterization of brain pathology, we propose in this paper a means to extract inter-regional correlation based features from local volumetric measurements. Specifically, our approach involves constructing an anatomical brain network for each subject, with each node representing a Region of Interest {(ROI)} and each edge representing Pearson correlation of tissue volumetric measurements between {ROI} pairs. As second order volumetric measurements, network features are more descriptive but also more sensitive to noise. To overcome this limitation, a hierarchy of {ROIs} is used to suppress noise at different scales. Pairwise interactions are considered not only for {ROIs} with the same scale in the same layer of the hierarchy, but also for {ROIs} across different scales in different layers. To address the high dimensionality problem resulting from the large number of network features, a supervised dimensionality reduction method is further employed to embed a selected subset of features into a low dimensional feature space, while at the same time preserving discriminative information. We demonstrate with experimental results the efficacy of this embedding strategy in comparison with some other commonly used approaches. In addition, although the proposed method can be easily generalized to incorporate other metrics of regional similarities, the benefits of using Pearson correlation in our application are reinforced by the experimental results. Without requiring new sources of information, our proposed approach improves the accuracy of {MCI} prediction from (of conventional volumetric features) to (of hierarchical network features), evaluated using data sets randomly drawn from the {ADNI} {(Alzheimer's} Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) dataset.},

	abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional {MRI} {(fMRI)}, is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using {fMRI)} and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

	abstract = {We describe a method for recovering the underlying parametrization of scattered data (mi) lying on a manifold M embedded in high-dimensional Euclidean space. The method, Hessian-based locally linear embedding, derives from a conceptual framework of local isometry in which the manifold M, viewed as a Riemannian submanifold of the ambient Euclidean space ℝn, is locally isometric to an open, connected subset Θ of Euclidean space ℝd. Because Θ does not have to be convex, this framework is able to handle a significantly wider class of situations than the original {ISOMAP} algorithm. The theoretical framework revolves around a quadratic form ℋ(f) = {∫M} {∥Hf(m)∥dm} defined on functions f : M ↦ ℝ. Here Hf denotes the Hessian of f, and ℋ(f) averages the Frobenius norm of the Hessian over M. To define the Hessian, we use orthogonal coordinates on the tangent planes of M. The key observation is that, if M truly is locally isometric to an open, connected subset of ℝd, then ℋ(f) has a (d + 1)-dimensional null space consisting of the constant functions and a d-dimensional space of functions spanned by the original isometric coordinates. Hence, the isometric coordinates can be recovered up to a linear isometry. Our method may be viewed as a modification of locally linear embedding and our theoretical framework as a modification of the Laplacian eigenmaps framework, where we substitute a quadratic form based on the Hessian in place of one based on the Laplacian.},

Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

It is shown that as little as 20-25\% of the Fourier spectrum is sufficient in practice for a high-quality reconstruction. The method employs linear programming to minimize the L1-norm of the output, because minimization of this norm favors solutions with isolated spikes. Given a wavelet, this technique can be used to perform deconvolution of noisy seismograms when the desired output is a sparse spike series. Relative reliability of the data is assessed in the frequency domain, and only the reliable spectral data are included in the calculation of the spike series. Equations for the unknown spike amplitudes are solved to an accuracy compatible with the uncertainties in the reliable data. In examples with 10\% random noise, the output is superior to that obtained using conventional least-squares techniques. {-Authors}},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Several neurobiological models of obsessive-compulsive disorder {(OCD)} posit a primary role for dysfunction of the anterior cingulate gyrus. Both functional and structural neuroimaging studies have implicated anterior cingulate gray matter abnormalities in the pathophysiology of {OCD}, but there has been little investigation of the anterior cingulate white matter in this disorder.


{OBJECTIVE}

To test the hypothesis that patients with {OCD} have abnormal white matter microstructure in the anterior cingulate gyrus compared with healthy volunteers as inferred from diffusion tensor imaging. Additional analyses examined group differences in white matter integrity across the entire brain.


{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PARTICIPANTS}

Fifteen patients with a {DSM-IV} diagnosis of {OCD} and 15 healthy volunteers matched for age, sex, and handedness underwent diffusion tensor imaging and structural magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Fractional anisotropy {(FA)}, a robust intravoxel measure of water self-diffusion, was compared between groups on a voxel-by-voxel basis in the anterior cingulate white matter after standardization in Talairach space.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Clinical ratings of symptom severity (ie, {Yale-Brown} {Obsessive-Compulsive} Scale) and {FA.}


{RESULTS}

Compared with healthy volunteers, patients demonstrated significantly lower {FA} bilaterally in 3 areas of the anterior cingulate gyrus white matter. Additional analyses conducted across the rest of the brain white matter revealed lower {FA} bilaterally in the parietal region (supramarginal gyri), right posterior cingulate gyrus, and left occipital lobe (lingual gyrus). No areas of significantly higher {FA} were observed in patients compared with healthy volunteers. Lower {FA} in the parietal region correlated significantly with higher {Yale-Brown} {Obsessive-Compulsive} Scale scores.


{CONCLUSIONS}

These preliminary findings provide evidence of an abnormality that involves the anterior cingulate white matter in the pathogenesis of {OCD} and are consistent with neurobiological models that posit a defect in connectivity in the anterior cingulate basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit. White matter abnormalities in other brain regions may also be implicated in the neurobiology of {OCD.}},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for deformable registration of diffusion tensor {(DT)} images that integrates geometry and orientation features into a hierarchical matching framework. The geometric feature is derived from the structural geometry of diffusion and characterizes the shape of the tensor in terms of prolateness, oblateness, and sphericity of the tensor. Local spatial distributions of the prolate, oblate, and spherical geometry are used to create an attribute vector of geometric feature for matching. The orientation feature improves the matching of the {WM} fiber tracts by taking into account the statistical information of underlying fiber orientations. These features are incorporated into a hierarchical deformable registration framework to develop a diffusion tensor image registration algorithm. Extensive experiments on simulated and real brain {DT} data establish the superiority of this algorithm for deformable matching of diffusion tensors, thereby aiding in atlas creation. The robustness of the method makes it potentially useful for group-based analysis of {DT} images acquired in large studies to identify disease-induced and developmental changes.},

Images were quantified using a region-of-interest approach and voxel-based morphometry analysis. We used a high-dimensional pattern classification approach to delineate brain regions that collectively formed the Spatial Pattern of Abnormalities for Recognition of {PDD.}


{SETTING}

The Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center at the University of Pennsylvania.


{SUBJECTS}

Eighty-four {PD} patients (61 {PD-NC}, 12 {PD-MCI}, and 11 {PDD)} and 23 healthy control subjects {(HCs)} underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.


{RESULTS}

The {PD-NC} patients did not demonstrate significant brain atrophy compared with {HCs.} Compared with {PD-NC} patients, {PD-MCI} patients had hippocampal atrophy (β = -0.37; P = .001), and {PDD} patients demonstrated hippocampal (β = -0.32; P = .004) and additional medial temporal lobe atrophy (β = -0.36; P = .003). The {PD-MCI} patients had a different pattern of atrophy compared with {PD-NC} patients {(P} = .04) and a similar pattern to that of {PDD} patients {(P} = .81), characterized by hippocampal, prefrontal cortex gray and white matter, occipital lobe gray and white matter, and parietal lobe white matter atrophy. In nondemented {PD} patients, there was a correlation between memory-encoding performance and hippocampal volume.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Hippocampal atrophy is a biomarker of initial cognitive decline in {PD}, including impaired memory encoding and storage, suggesting heterogeneity in the neural substrate of memory impairment. Use of a pattern classification approach may allow identification of diffuse regions of cortical gray and white matter atrophy early in the course of cognitive decline.},

	title = {Supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction for visualization and classification},
	volume = {35},
	abstract = {When performing visualization and classification, people often confront the problem of dimensionality reduction. Isomap is one of the most promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. However, when Isomap is applied to real-world data, it shows some limitations, such as being sensitive to noise. In this paper, an improved version of Isomap, namely {S-Isomap}, is proposed. {S-Isomap} utilizes class information to guide the procedure of nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Such a kind of procedure is called supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In {S-Isomap}, the neighborhood graph of the input data is constructed according to a certain kind of dissimilarity between data points, which is specially designed to integrate the class information. The dissimilarity has several good properties which help to discover the true neighborhood of the data and, thus, makes {S-Isomap} a robust technique for both visualization and classification, especially for real-world problems. In the visualization experiments, {S-Isomap} is compared with Isomap, {LLE}, and {WeightedIso.} The results show that {S-Isomap} performs the best. In the classification experiments, {S-Isomap} is used as a preprocess of classification and compared with Isomap, {WeightedIso}, as well as some other well-established classification methods, including the K-nearest neighbor classifier, {BP} neural network, J4.8 decision tree, and {SVM.} The results reveal that {S-Isomap} excels compared to Isomap and {WeightedIso} in classification, and it is highly competitive with those well-known classification methods. © 2005 {IEEE.}},

	abstract = {Joint tissues are exquisitely sensitive to their mechanical environment, and mechanical loading may be the most important external factor regulating the development and long-term maintenance of joint tissues. Moderate mechanical loading maintains the integrity of articular cartilage; however, both disuse and overuse can result in cartilage degradation. The irreversible destruction of cartilage is the hallmark of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In these instances of cartilage breakdown, inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulate the production of matrix metalloproteinases {(MMPs)} and aggrecanases {(ADAMTSs)}, enzymes that can degrade components of the cartilage extracellular matrix. In order to prevent cartilage destruction, tremendous effort has been expended to design inhibitors of {MMP/ADAMTS} activity and/or synthesis. To date, however, no effective clinical inhibitors exist. Accumulating evidence suggests that physiologic joint loading helps maintain cartilage integrity; however, the mechanisms by which these mechanical stimuli regulate joint homeostasis are still being elucidated. Identifying mechanosensitive chondroprotective pathways may reveal novel targets or therapeutic strategies in preventing cartilage destruction in joint disease.},

Calcium is a key regulator of mitochondrial function and acts at several levels within the organelle to stimulate {ATP} synthesis. However, the dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) homeostasis is now recognized to play a key role in several pathologies. For example, mitochondrial matrix Ca(2+) overload can lead to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species, triggering of the permeability transition pore, and cytochrome c release, leading to apoptosis. Despite progress regarding the independent roles of both Ca(2+) and mitochondrial dysfunction in disease, the molecular mechanisms by which Ca(2+) can elicit mitochondrial dysfunction remain elusive. This review highlights the delicate balance between the positive and negative effects of Ca(2+) and the signaling events that perturb this balance. Overall, a "two-hit" hypothesis is developed, in which Ca(2+) plus another pathological stimulus can bring about mitochondrial dysfunction.},

	abstract = {We develop a face recognition algorithm which is insensitive to large variation in lighting direction and facial expression. Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a {3D} linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's Linear Discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The Eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed {"Fisherface"} method has error rates that are lower than those of the Eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale Face Databases. ©1997 {IEEE.}},

Compared with controls, {HD} patients had significantly decreased callosal measures in extended regions across almost the entire {CC.} At this disease stage, both myelin and axonal damage are detectable.

	abstract = {We propose a novel framework for the automatic propagation of a set of manually labeled brain atlases to a diverse set of images of a population of subjects. A manifold is learned from a coordinate system embedding that allows the identification of neighborhoods which contain images that are similar based on a chosen criterion. Within the new coordinate system, the initial set of atlases is propagated to all images through a succession of multi-atlas segmentation steps. This breaks the problem of registering images that are very "dissimilar" down into a problem of registering a series of images that are "similar". At the same time, it allows the potentially large deformation between the images to be modeled as a sequence of several smaller deformations. We applied the proposed method to an exemplar region centered around the hippocampus from a set of 30 atlases based on images from young healthy subjects and a dataset of 796 images from elderly dementia patients and age-matched controls enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative {(ADNI).} We demonstrate an increasing gain in accuracy of the new method, compared to standard multi-atlas segmentation, with increasing distance between the target image and the initial set of atlases in the coordinate embedding, i.e., with a greater difference between atlas and image. For the segmentation of the hippocampus on 182 images for which a manual segmentation is available, we achieved an average overlap {(Dice} coefficient) of 0.85 with the manual reference. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Strain field mapping experiments with colloidal probes show that local forces induce a strain field exhibiting a range of zeta = 10 +/- 1 microm, but which could only be observed if nonmagnetic beads were coupled to the cell surface by invasin. By application of the theory of elasticity of planar bodies we estimated a surface shear modulus of 2.5 x10(-4) N/m. By assuming a thickness of the actin cortex of approximately 0.5 microm we estimate a Young modulus micro approximately 400 Pa for the apical membrane. The value agrees with a plateau modulus of an entangled or weakly cross-linked actin network of an actin concentration of 100 {microM} (mesh size 0.2 microm). This result together with our observation of a strong reduction of the shear modulus by the actin destabilizing agent latrunculin A suggests that the shear modulus measured by our technique is determined by the actin cortex. The effect of two ligands inducing actin stress fiber formation and centripetal contraction of cells (associated with the formation of gaps in the confluent cell monolayer) on the viscoelastic responses were studied: histamine and lysophosphatidic acid {(LPA).} Histamine evoked a dramatic increase of the cell stiffness by {\textgreater}1 order of magnitude within {\textless}30 s, which is attributed to a transient rise of the intracellular Ca(2+) level, since {DMSO} exerted a similar effect. The stiffening is accompanied by a concomitant rounding of the cells as observed by microinterferometry and relaxes partially in the timescale of 5 min, whereas gaps between cells close after approximately 30 min. {LPA} did not exert a remarkable and reproducible effect other than an occasional very weak transient increase of the shear stiffness, which shows that the gap formation activated by {LPA} is mediated by a different mechanism than that induced by histamine.},

	abstract = {Appearance and shape are two key elements exploited in medical image segmentation. However, in some medical image analysis tasks, appearance cues are weak/misleading due to disease/artifacts and often lead to erroneous segmentation. In this paper, a novel deformable model is proposed for robust segmentation in the presence of weak/misleading appearance cues. Owing to the less trustable appearance information, this method focuses on the effective shape modeling with two contributions. First, a shape composition method is designed to incorporate shape prior on-the-fly. Based on two sparsity observations, this method is robust to false appearance information and adaptive to statistically insignificant shape modes. Second, shape priors are modeled and used in a hierarchical fashion. More specifically, by using affinity propagation method, our deformable surface is divided into multiple partitions, on which local shape models are built independently. This scheme facilitates a more compact shape prior modeling and hence a more robust and efficient segmentation. Our deformable model is applied on two very diverse segmentation problems, liver segmentation in {PET-CT} images and rodent brain segmentation in {MR} images. Compared to state-of-art methods, our method achieves better performance in both studies.},

Current {CT} contrast agents are based on small iodinated molecules. They are effective in absorbing X-rays, but non-specific distribution and rapid pharmacokinetics have rather limited their microvascular and targeting performance. Here we propose the use of a polymer-coated {Bi(2)S(3)} nanoparticle preparation as an injectable {CT} imaging agent. This preparation demonstrates excellent stability at high concentrations (0.25 M Bi(3+)), high X-ray absorption (fivefold better than iodine), very long circulation times ({\textgreater}2 h) in vivo and an efficacy/safety profile comparable to or better than iodinated imaging agents. We show the utility of these polymer-coated {Bi(2)S(3)} nanoparticles for enhanced in vivo imaging of the vasculature, the liver and lymph nodes in mice.

Principal component scores were used to discriminate between {AD} patients and controls and between {MCI} converters and {MCI} non-converters. We found a significant regional pattern of atrophy (p {\textless} 0.001) in medial temporal lobes, neocortical association areas, thalamus and basal ganglia and corresponding widening of cerebrospinal fluid {(CSF)} spaces (p {\textless} 0.001) in {AD} patients compared to controls. Accuracy was 81\% for {CSF-} and 83\% for brain-based deformation maps to separate {AD} patients from controls. Nine out of 24 {MCI} patients converted to {AD} during clinical follow-up. Discrimination between {MCI} converters and non-converters reached 80\% accuracy based on {CSF} maps and 73\% accuracy based on brain maps. In a logistic regression model, principal component scores based on {CSF} maps predicted clinical outcome in {MCI} patients even after controlling for age, gender, {MMSE} score and time of follow-up. Our findings indicate that multivariate network analysis of deformation maps detects typical features of {AD} pathology and provides a powerful tool to predict conversion into {AD} in non-demented at risk patients. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

We assume that the probability densities associated with the image pixel intensities within each region are completely unknown a priori, and we formulate the problem based on nonparametric density estimates. Due to the nonparametric structure, our method does not require the image regions to have a particular type of probability distribution and does not require the extraction and use of a particular statistic. We solve the information-theoretic optimization problem by deriving the associated gradient flows and applying curve evolution techniques. We use level-set methods to implement the resulting evolution. The experimental results based on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed technique can solve a variety of challenging image segmentation problems. Futhermore, our method, which does not require any training, performs as good as methods based on training.},

However, the relationship of {FA} to other structural indices of cerebral health has not been well studied. We hypothesized that the decline in {WM} health will be associated with changes in several other indices of cerebral health. In this manuscript we studied the correlation between whole-brain/hemispheric/corpus callosum {FA} and gray matter {(GM)} thickness, sulcal span, and the volume of T2-hyperintense {WM} in a group of 31 healthy aging individuals (12 males/19 females) aged 57–82 years old. Individual subjects' {FA} measures were calculated from diffusion tracing imaging {(DTI)} data using tract-based spatial statistics—an approach specifically designed and validated for voxel-wise multi-subject {FA} analysis. Age-controlled correlation analysis showed that whole-brain average {FA} values were significantly and positively correlated with the subject's average {GM} thickness and negatively correlated with hyperintense {WM} volume. Intra-hemispheric correlations between {FA} and other measures of cerebral health had generally greater effect sizes than inter-hemispheric correction, with correlation between left {FA} and left {GM} thickness being the most significant (r\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.6, p\&\#xa0;\&lt;\&\#xa0;0.01). Regional analysis of {FA} values showed that late-myelinating fiber tracts of the genu of corpus callosum had higher association with other cerebral health indices. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that late-myelinating regions of the brain bear the brunt of age-related degenerative changes.},

A mixed model regression analysis was used to compare {FA} and {MD} between the {ALS} and control groups. , Results: {FA} showed a downward linear trend from the cerebral peduncles to the pyramids and was lower in the {ALS} group than controls at multiple levels of the corticospinal tract. At the internal capsules, {FA} was higher on the right. {MD} showed an upward trend, progressing caudally from the internal capsules to the pyramids. {MD} was higher at the level of the internal capsule in the {ALS} group, but caudally this difference was not maintained. No correlations were found between clinical markers of disability and water diffusion indices. , Conclusions: These findings provide insights into the pathological processes of {ALS.} Differences in diffusion characteristics at different anatomical levels may relate to underlying tract architecture or the distribution of pathological damage in {ALS.} Further development may permit monitoring of progression and treatment of disease.},

Therefore, {NPE} is less sensitive to outliers than {PCA.} Also, comparing to the recently proposed manifold learning algorithms such as Isomap and Locally Linear Embedding, {NPE} is defined everywhere, rather than only on the training data points. Furthermore, {NPE} may be conducted in the original space or in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space into which data points are mapped.

To assess structural brain maturation from childhood to adulthood, we charted brain development in subjects aged 5 to 30 years using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, a novel brain imaging technique that is sensitive to axonal packing and myelination and is particularly adept at virtually extracting white matter connections. Age-related changes were seen in major white matter tracts, deep gray matter, and subcortical white matter, in our large (n = 202), age-distributed sample. These diffusion changes followed an exponential pattern of maturation with considerable regional variation. Differences observed in developmental timing suggest a pattern of maturation in which areas with fronto-temporal connections develop more slowly than other regions. These in vivo results expand upon previous postmortem and imaging studies and provide quantitative measures indicative of the progression and magnitude of regional human brain maturation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Atherosclerosis, diabetes, heart failure, and ischemia with attendant reperfusion injury share many of the same risk factors, among the most important being oxidative stress and alterations in the blood concentrations of compounds that influence oxidative stress, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein. In this review, we focus on endothelial cells: cells in the frontline against these disturbances. Because {ATP} supplies in endothelial cells are relatively independent of mitochondrial oxidative pathways, the mitochondria of endothelial cells have been somewhat neglected. However, they are emerging as agents with diverse roles in modulating the dynamics of intracellular calcium and the generation of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. The mitochondria may also constitute critical "targets" of oxidative stress, because survival of endothelial cells can be compromised by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore or by mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. In addition, evidence suggests that endothelial mitochondria may play a "reconnaissance" role. For example, although the exact mechanism remains obscure, endothelial mitochondria may sense levels of oxygen in the blood and relay this information to cardiac myocytes as well as modulating the vasodilatory response mediated by endothelial nitric oxide.},

	abstract = {The goal of probabilistic tractography is to obtain a connectivity index along a white matter pathway that reflects fibre organization and is sensitive to pathological abnormalities contributing to disability. Here, we present the development of voxel-based connectivity measures along the tractography-derived corticospinal tract {(CST).} We investigated whether these connectivity measures are different in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis {(ALS)} and correlate with the rate of disease progression. We also investigated whether fractional anisotropy {(FA)}, which reflects directional coherence of fibre tracts, is reduced in the {CST} of {ALS} patients and relates to disease progression rate. Thirteen patients with probable or definite {ALS} and 19 healthy subjects were studied. The probabilistic tractography algorithm segmented the bilateral {CST}, along which {FA} and connectivity values were obtained. To take into account the asymmetric distribution of connectivity values, two summary statistic measures that focused on voxels with higher connectivity values were selected and then used in the analysis, together with the mean connectivity and the mean {FA.} To complete the analysis, the same summary measures for {FA} were included. Differences in all these indices between patients with moderate or rapid disease progression rate and controls were investigated using linear regression, adjusted for age and white matter fraction. The association between {FA} or connectivity in the {CST} and the disease progression rate was assessed using linear regression. Patients with a rapid disease progression rate had significantly lower summary connectivity measures than controls in the left {CST}, but there was only a borderline statistical difference in mean connectivity. Patients with rapid progression had a significantly lower mean {FA}, and any other {FA} measure, in both {CSTs} than controls. When only patients were considered, strong associations between the rate of disease progression and all the connectivity measures in the left {CST} were found {(P-values} between P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.002, partial correlation coefficients between −0.90 and −0.82). However, there was no evidence of an association between disease progression rate and any of the {FA} measures in the bilateral {CST.} Our findings suggest that {FA} and connectivity provide complementary information, since {FA} is sensitive to the detection of all the group differences, whereas the summary connectivity measures correlate with disease progression rate. The development of such connectivity measures raises their potential as markers of disease progression in {ALS}, and provides guidance for their use in other neurological diseases.},

We consider the problem of constructing a representation for data lying on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high-dimensional data. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality-preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering.

	abstract = {While a pathway for Ca2+ accumulation into mitochondria has long been established, its functional significance is only now becoming clear in relation to cell physiology and pathophysiology. The observation that mitochondria take up Ca2+ during physiological Ca2+ signalling in a variety of cell types leads to four questions: (i) {'What} is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on mitochondrial function?' (ii) {'What} is the impact of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on Ca2+ signalling?' (iii) {'What} are the consequences of impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake for cell function?' and finally (iv) {'What} are the consequences of pathological {[Ca2+]c} signalling for mitochondrial function?' These will be addressed in turn. Thus: (i) accumulation of Ca2+ into mitochondria regulates mitochondrial metabolism and causes a transient depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential. (ii) Mitochondria may act as a spatial Ca2+ buffer in many cells, regulating the local Ca2+ concentration in cellular microdomains. This process regulates processes dependent on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration {([Ca2+]c)}, particularly the flux of Ca2+ through {IP3-gated} channels of the endoplasmic reticulum {(ER)} and the channels mediating capacitative Ca2+ influx through the plasma membrane. Consequently, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays a substantial role in shaping {[Ca2+]c} signals in many cell types. (iii) Impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake alters the spatiotemporal characteristics of cellular {[Ca2+]c} signalling and downregulates mitochondrial metabolism. (iv) Under pathological conditions of cellular {[Ca2+]c} overload, particularly in association with oxidative stress, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake may trigger pathological states that lead to cell death. In the model of glutamate excitotoxicity, microdomains of {[Ca2+]c} are apparently central, as the pathway to cell death seems to require the local activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase {(nNOS)}, itself held by scaffolding proteins in close association with the {NMDA} receptor. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in combination with {NO} production triggers the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, culminating in delayed cell death.},

The form of this penalty encourages sparse solutions (with many coefficients equal to 0). We propose the ‘fused lasso’, a generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences—i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the ‘hinge’ loss function that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.},

	abstract = {Large scale genomic studies with multiple phenotypic or genotypic measures may require the identification of complex multivariate relationships. In multivariate analysis a common way to inspect the relationship between two sets of variables based on their correlation is canonical correlation analysis, which determines linear combinations of all variables of each type with maximal correlation between the two linear combinations. However, in high dimensional data analysis, when the number of variables under consideration exceeds tens of thousands, linear combinations of the entire sets of features may lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In addition, insufficient sample size may lead to computational problems, inaccurate estimates of parameters and non-generalizable results. These problems may be solved by selecting sparse subsets of variables, i.e. obtaining sparse loadings in the linear combinations of variables of each type. In this paper we present Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis {(SCCA)} which examines the relationships between two types of variables and provides sparse solutions that include only small subsets of variables of each type by maximizing the correlation between the subsets of variables of different types while performing variable selection. We also present an extension of {SCCA--adaptive} {SCCA.} We evaluate their properties using simulated data and illustrate practical use by applying both methods to the study of natural variation in human gene expression.},

Voxel-wise parametric statistical tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made using the theory of Gaussian random fields.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT.} Molecular biologic techniques are currently considered as new diagnostic and prognostic parameters with a sensitivity and specificity exceeding those of histologic and functional data currently used in clinical practice. The results in various clinical settings have been of limited value up to now. This study is an investigation of the use of tissue levels of {RNA} determined in routine clinical kidney biopsies as prognostic tools. The focus was on {RNA} encoding for molecules known to be involved in the pathogenesis of renal disorders. Fresh kidney biopsy tissue was obtained from 52 patients with various renal diseases. The {GFR} was followed for 12 mo. The extent of glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis in the biopsies was determined with quantitative digital image analysis. Glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments from each biopsy specimen were separated, and {mRNA} levels of {TGF-}, collagen I, collagen {IV}, and fibronectin were quantitated by real-time {PCR.} Correlations, along with 95\% confidence intervals {(CI)}, between all variables tested at time biopsy were determined. To assess their prognostic value, these variables were correlated with the slope of {GFR} within several time intervals after biopsy. In addition, to evaluate the predictive value of the variables for outcome in individual patients, differences for each variable were tested between patients showing progressive decline in renal function (slope {GFR} {\textless} 0) and patients showing stable or improving renal function over time (slope {GFR} ≥ 0). In chronic renal diseases, the extent of histologic damage correlated with the {GFR} at the time of biopsy (r = -0.44; {CI} -0.68 to -0.11), but it did not correlate with the slope expressing a change in {GFR} after the biopsy. Tubulointerstitial {TGF-} {mRNA} levels correlated with the rate of change in {GFR} between time of biopsy and 1 mo later (r = 0.41; {CI}, 0.07 to 0.67). The {GFR} at the time of biopsy correlated with the slope of change in {GFR} between time of biopsy and 12 mo later (r = -0.50; {CI}, -0.73 to -0.18). In chronic renal diseases, glomerular fibronectin {mRNA} levels, in comparison with the {GFR} at time of biopsy, correlated relatively strongly with the slope of change in {GFR} between 3 and 12 mo (r = 0.50; {CI}, 0.16 to 0.74). Patients with favorable renal outcome after 12 mo showed significantly higher {TGF-} {mRNA} levels and lower proteinuria levels at time of biopsy {(P} {\textless} 0.05) than patients with a progressive decline in renal function. This study shows that {mRNA} levels measured in kidney biopsies can function as prognostic tools in human renal diseases. In particular, relatively high levels of tubulointerstitial {TGF-} {mRNA} and glomerular fibronectin {mRNA} are associated with less deterioration in renal function. E-mail: {M.Eikmans@LUMC.NL}},

Sparse models use a small subset of the available variables and may perform as well or better than their full counterparts if constructed carefully. In most medical applications, models are required to have both good statistical performance and a relevant clinical interpretation to be of value. Morphometry of the corpus callosum is one illustrative example. This paper presents a method for relating spatial features to clinical outcome data. A set of parsimonious variables is extracted using sparse principal component analysis, producing simple yet characteristic features. The relation of these variables with clinical data is then established using a regression model. The result may be visualized as patterns of anatomical variation related to clinical outcome. In the present application, landmark-based shape data of the corpus callosum is analyzed in relation to age, gender, and clinical tests of walking speed and verbal fluency. To put the data-driven sparse principal component method into perspective, we consider two alternative techniques, one where features are derived using a model-based wavelet approach, and one where the original variables are regressed directly on the outcome.},

These predictions have relied on an assumption that the responses of the canals can be determined from their dimensions, and that an organism's behavior can be determined from these responses. However, the relationship between a canal's sensitivity and its size is not well known. An intraspecies comparison among canal responses in each of three species (cat, squirrel monkey, and pigeon) was undertaken to evaluate various models of canal function and determine how their dimensions may be related to afferent physiology. All models predicted the responses of the cat afferents, but the models performed less well for squirrel monkey and pigeon. Possible causes for this discrepancy include incorrectly assuming that afferent responses accurately represent canal function or errors in current biophysical models of the canals. These findings leave open the question as to how reliably canal anatomy can be used to estimate afferent responses and how closely afferent responses are related to behavior. Other labyrinthine features, such as orientation of the horizontal canal, which is reliably held near earth-horizontal across many species, may be better to use when extrapolating the posture and related behavior of extinct animals from labyrinthine morphology.},

In this study, we created a white matter parcellation atlas based on probabilistic maps of 11 major white matter tracts derived from the {DTI} data from 28 normal subjects. Using these probabilistic maps, automated tract-specific quantification of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity were performed. Excellent correlation was found between the automated and the individual tractography-based results. This tool allows efficient initial screening of the status of multiple white matter tracts.},

In this study we show how mechanical stress perturbs the intracellular structures of the cell and induces mechanical responses. In order to correlate mechanical perturbations to cellular responses, we used a combined fluorescence-atomic force microscope {(AFM)} to produce well defined nanomechanical perturbations of 10 {nN} while simultaneously tracking the real-time motion of fluorescently labelled mitochondria in live cells. The spatial displacement of the organelles in response to applied loads demonstrates the highly dynamic mechanical response of mitochondria in fibroblast cells. The average displacement of all mitochondrial structures analysed showed an increase of approximately 40\%, post-perturbation ( approximately 160 nm in comparison to basal displacements of approximately 110 nm). These results show that local forces can produce organelle displacements at locations far from the initial point of contact (up to approximately 40 microm). In order to examine the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission and its effect on mitochondrial displacements, both the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton were disrupted using Cytochalasin D and Nocodazole, respectively. Our results show that there is no significant change in mitochondrial displacement following indentation after such treatments. These results demonstrate the role of the cytoskeleton in force transmission through the cell and on mitochondrial displacements. In addition, it is suggested that care must be taken when performing mechanical experiments on living cells with the {AFM}, as these local mechanical perturbations may have significant structural and even biochemical effects on the cell.},

	volume = {20},
	abstract = {The finite mixture {(FM)} model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance {(MR)} images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain {MR} images. However, being a histogram-based model, the {FM} has an intrinsic limitation-no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the {FM} model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, {FM} model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field {(HMRF)} model, which is a stochastic process generated by a {MRF} whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the {FM} model is a degenerate version of the {HMRF} model. The advantage of the {HMRF} model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although {MRF} modeling has been employed in {MR} image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using {MRF} as a general prior in an {FM} model-based approach. To fit the {HMRF} model, an {EM} algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the {HMRF} model and the {EM} algorithm into a {HMRF-EM} framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the {HMRF-EM} framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain {MR} image segmentation.},

	abstract = {In many multivariate statistical techniques, a set of linear functions of the original p variables is produced. One of the more difficult aspects of these techniques is the interpretation of the linear functions, as these functions usually have nonzero coefficients on all p variables. A common approach is to effectively ignore (treat as zero) any coefficients less than some threshold value, so that the function becomes simple and the interpretation becomes easier for the users. Such a procedure can be misleading. There are alternatives to principal component analysis which restrict the coefficients to a smaller number of possible values in the derivation of the linear functions, or replace the principal components by "principal variables." This article introduces a new technique, borrowing an idea proposed by Tibshirani in the context of multiple regression where similar problems arise in interpreting regression equations. This approach is the so-called {LASSO}, the "least absolute shrinkage and selection operator," in which a bound is introduced on the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, and in which some coefficients consequently become zero. We explore some of the properties of the new technique, both theoretically and using simulation studies, and apply it to an example.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis {(PCA)} is a widely used tool for data analysis and dimension reduction in applications throughout science and engineering. However, the principal components {(PCs)} can sometimes be difficult to interpret, because they are linear combinations of all the original variables. To facilitate interpretation, sparse {PCA} produces modified {PCs} with sparse loadings, i.e. loadings with very few non-zero elements. In this paper, we propose a new sparse {PCA} method, namely sparse {PCA} via regularized {SVD} {(sPCA-rSVD).} We use the connection of {PCA} with singular value decomposition {(SVD)} of the data matrix and extract the {PCs} through solving a low rank matrix approximation problem. Regularization penalties are introduced to the corresponding minimization problem to promote sparsity in {PC} loadings. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for computation. Two tuning parameter selection methods are discussed. Some theoretical results are established to justify the use of {sPCA-rSVD} when only the data covariance matrix is available. In addition, we give a modified definition of variance explained by the sparse {PCs.} The {sPCA-rSVD} provides a uniform treatment of both classical multivariate data and high-dimension-low-sample-size {(HDLSS)} data. Further understanding of {sPCA-rSVD} and some existing alternatives is gained through simulation studies and real data examples, which suggests that {sPCA-rSVD} provides competitive results. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes, e.g. those based on {fuzzy-C-means} {(FCM)}, incorporate Gaussian class models which are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters. Fiber bundles in {DT} images, however, comprise tensors that can inherently lie on more-complex manifolds. Unlike {FCM-based} schemes, the proposed method relies on modeling the manifolds underlying the classes by incorporating nonparametric data-driven statistical models. It produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework. For {DT} images, the paper describes a consistent statistical technique for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian {DT} spaces that incorporates two very recent works. In this way, the proposed method provides uncertainties in the segmentation decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial voluming, and inhomogeneity.

The fundamental assumption of our fiber segmentation technique is that adjacent voxels in a tract have similar properties of diffusion. The fiber segmentation is carried out with a front propagation algorithm constructed to fill the whole fiber tract. The front is a {3D} surface that evolves with a propagation speed proportional to a measure indicating the similarity of diffusion between the tensors lying on the surface and their neighbors in the direction of propagation. We use a level set implementation to assure a stable and accurate evolution of the surface and to handle changes of topology of the surface during the evolution process. The fiber tract segmentation method does not need a regularized tensor field since the surface is automatically smoothed as it propagates. The smoothing is done by an intrinsic surface force, based on the minimal principal curvature. This segmentation can be used for obtaining quantitative measures of the diffusion in the fiber tracts and it can also be used for white matter registration and for surgical planning.},

Contrast media are indispensable to more clearly differentiate anatomic structures and to detect and characterize abnormalities. Depending on the indication up to 200 ml of these agents are injected during {CT.} Despite these large amounts adverse effects are rare and have further decreased with the introduction of non-ionic substances. However, it took 10 to 20 years until these non-ionic agents replaced the older ionic agents in clinical practice. In recent years no new substance has been brought to the market. The introduction of rapid scanning using multislice {CT} technology, however, has led to the development of more sophisticated contrast injection techniques. Current research focuses on optimizing contrast application techniques and on further evaluating the safety profiles of the various substances. The amount of contrast enhancement obtained in individual patients for instance depends on the contrast agent characteristics, such as iodine concentration, and the parameters of the contrast injection protocol, such as iodine flux and iodine dose. Meanwhile, contrast agent characteristics such as osmolality and viscosity play a role in the safety profile of an agent.

	abstract = {Highly accurate surface models of the cerebral cortex are becoming increasingly important as tools in the investigation of the functional organization of the human brain. The construction of such models is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel misclassifications can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model. These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening, or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model, but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate models. In order to address this need we have developed a technique for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically correct.},

Methods An International Harmonization Project {(IHP)} was convened to discuss standardization of clinical trial parameters in lymphoma. An imaging subcommittee developed consensus recommendations based on published {PET} literature and the collective expertise of its members in the use of {PET} in lymphoma. Only recommendations subsequently endorsed by all {IHP} subcommittees were adopted.
Recommendations {PET} after completion of therapy should be performed at least 3 weeks, and preferably at 6 to 8 weeks, after chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy, and 8 to 12 weeks after radiation or chemoradiotherapy. Visual assessment alone is adequate for interpreting {PET} findings as positive or negative when assessing response after completion of therapy. Mediastinal blood pool activity is recommended as the reference background activity to define {PET} positivity for a residual mass ≥ 2 cm in greatest transverse diameter, regardless of its location. A smaller residual mass or a normal sized lymph node (ie, ≤ 1 × 1 cm in diameter) should be considered positive if its activity is above that of the surrounding background. Specific criteria for defining {PET} positivity in the liver, spleen, lung, and bone marrow are also proposed. Use of attenuation-corrected {PET} is strongly encouraged. Use of {PET} for treatment monitoring during a course of therapy should only be done in a clinical trial or as part of a prospective registry.},

	abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization {(NMF)}, i.e. V ap {WH} where both V, W and H are non-negative has become a widely used blind source separation technique due to its part based representation. The {NMF} decomposition is not in general unique and a part based representation not guaranteed. However, imposing sparseness both improves the uniqueness of the decomposition and favors part based representation. Sparseness in the form of attaining as many zero elements in the solution as possible is appealing from a conceptional point of view and corresponds to minimizing reconstruction error with an L{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} norm constraint. In general, solving for a given L{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} norm is an {NP} hard problem thus convex relaxation to regularization by the L{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} norm is often considered, i.e., minimizing {(1/2{\textbar}{\textbar}V} - {WH{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}F{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}} {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} + {lambda{\textbar}{\textbar}H{\textbar}{\textbar}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}).An} open problem is to control the degree of sparsity lambda imposed. We here demonstrate that a full regularization path for the L{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} norm regularized least squares {NMF} for fixed W can be calculated at the cost of an ordinary least squares solution based on a modification of the least angle regression and selection {(LARS)} algorithm forming a non-negativity constrained {LARS} {(NLARS).} With the full regularization path, the L{\textless}sub{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} regularization strength lambda that best approximates a given L{\textless}sub{\textgreater}0{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} can be directly accessed and in effect used to control the sparsity of H.

	abstract = {Functional brain networks detected in task-free ("resting-state") functional magnetic resonance imaging {(fMRI)} have a small-world architecture that reflects a robust functional organization of the brain. Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease {(AD).} Task-free {fMRI} data from 21 {AD} subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the {fMRI} data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in {AD} showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p{\textless}0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p{\textless}0.01) in the {AD} group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished {AD} participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72\% and specificity of 78\%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in {AD.} Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in {AD}, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish {AD} from healthy aging. © 2008 Supekar et al.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} This prospective study employs anisotropic diffusion-weighted {(ADW)} magnetic resonance imaging for the integration of individual spatial information concerning the principal motor pathways into the operating room during microneurosurgery in the central region. We hypothesize that the three-dimensional {(3-D)} visualization of the pyramidal tract position {(PTV)} in a neuronavigation system based on {ADW} provides valid information concerning the position and extension of the principal motor pathways. {METHODS} A total of 13 consecutive patients with lesions adjacent to the pyramidal tracts and the central region underwent microneurosurgery with the help of pyramidal tract visualization {(PTV).} An {ADW} sequence obtained preoperatively was fused to an anatomic navigation sequence. The {3-D} reconstructions of the precentral gyrus {(PG)}, the pyramidal tract, and the tumor were available in a customized neuronavigation system during surgery. Intraoperatively the {PG} was identified on the basis of the aforementioned data. Electric motorcortex stimulation {(CS)} was used to directly verify the {PG} location and indirectly the fiber tract position. {RESULTS} In 11 cases (92\%) the prediction of the principal motor pathways' position was correct. In one case of a meningioma, according to {PTV}, the tumor was falsely localized postcentrally. In the case of a precentral cavernoma, no motor response could be elicited by cortical stimulation. {CONCLUSION} Intraoperative {PTV} on the basis of {ADW} provides the neurosurgeon with reliable information concerning the position of the principal motor pathways during intracranial procedures as proved with intraoperative electrophysiological testing. The technique has the potential to reduce operative morbidity. {PTV} is straightforward and can be adapted to other customized neuronavigation devices.},

With diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)}, diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional {MRI}, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. {DTI} has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols.

	abstract = {We address the problem of the segmentation of cerebral white matter structures from diffusion tensor images {(DTI).} A {DTI} produces, from a set of diffusion-weighted {MR} images, tensor-valued images where each voxel is assigned with a 3 x 3 symmetric, positive-definite matrix. This second order tensor is simply the covariance matrix of a local Gaussian process, with zero-mean, modeling the average motion of water molecules. As we will show in this paper, the definition of a dissimilarity measure and statistics between such quantities is a nontrivial task which must be tackled carefully. We claim and demonstrate that, by using the theoretically well-founded differential geometrical properties of the manifold of multivariate normal distributions, it is possible to improve the quality of the segmentation results obtained with other dissimilarity measures such as the Euclidean distance or the {Kullback-Leibler} divergence. The main goal of this paper is to prove that the choice of the probability metric, i.e., the dissimilarity measure, has a deep impact on the tensor statistics and, hence, on the achieved results. We introduce a variational formulation, in the level-set framework, to estimate the optimal segmentation of a {DTI} according to the following hypothesis: Diffusion tensors exhibit a Gaussian distribution in the different partitions. We must also respect the geometric constraints imposed by the interfaces existing among the cerebral structures and detected by the gradient of the {DTI.} We show how to express all the statistical quantities for the different probability metrics. We validate and compare the results obtained on various synthetic data-sets, a biological rat spinal cord phantom and human brain {DTIs.}},

Because of the large number of genes and the complexity of biological networks, clustering is a useful exploratory technique for analysis of gene expression data. Other classical techniques, such as principal component analysis {(PCA)}, have also been applied to analyze gene expression data. Using different data analysis techniques and different clustering algorithms to analyze the same data set can lead to very different conclusions. Our goal is to study the effectiveness of principal components {(PCs)} in capturing cluster structure. Specifically, using both real and synthetic gene expression data sets, we compared the quality of clusters obtained from the original data to the quality of clusters obtained after projecting onto subsets of the principal component axes. Results: Our empirical study showed that clustering with the {PCs} instead of the original variables does not necessarily improve, and often degrades, cluster quality. In particular, the first few {PCs} (which contain most of the variation in the data) do not necessarily capture most of the cluster structure. We also showed that clustering with {PCs} has different impact on different algorithms and different similarity metrics. Overall, we would not recommend {PCA} before clustering except in special circumstances.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the model problem of reconstructing an object from incomplete frequency samples. Consider a discrete-time signal f ∈ {CN} and a randomly chosen set of frequencies Ω. It is possible to reconstruct f from the partial knowledge of its Fourier coefficients on the set Ω? A typical result of this paper is as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of T spikes f(t) = {∑τ∈T} f(τ)δ(t-τ) obeying T ≤ {CM} · (log N)-1 · Ω for some constant {CM} \&gt; 0. We do not know the locations of the spikes nor their amplitudes. Then with probability at least 1 - {O(N-M}, f can be reconstructed exactly as the solution to the ℓ1 minimization problem {ming∑t=oN-1} g(t) , s.t.ĝ(ω) = f̂(ω) for all ω ∈ Ω. In short, exact recovery may be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. We give numerical values for {CM} which depend on the desired probability of success. Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of T spikes may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies of size O( T · log N). Moreover, this is nearly optimal in the sense that any method succeeding with probability 1 - {O(N-M)} would in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional to T · log N. The methodology extends to a variety of other situations and higher dimensions. For example, we show how one can reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object from incomplete frequency samples - provided that the number of jumps (discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other convex functionals such as the total variation of f. © 2006 {IEEE.}},

	abstract = {We consider a linear regression problem in a high dimensional setting where the number of covariates p can be much larger than the sam- ple size n. In such a situation, one often assumes sparsity of the regression vector, i.e., the regression vector contains many zero components. We pro- pose a Lasso-type estimator β 
                        Quad (where {'Quad'} stands for quadratic) which is based on two penalty terms. The first one is the ℓ 
                        1 norm of the re- gression coefficients used to exploit the sparsity of the regression as done by the Lasso estimator, whereas the second is a quadratic penalty term intro- duced to capture some additional information on the setting of the problem. We detail two special cases: the {Elastic-Net} β 
                        {EN} introduced in. [42], which deals with sparse problems where correlations between variables may exist; and the {Smooth-Lasso†} β 
                        {SL}, which responds to sparse problems where successive regression coefficients are known to vary slowly (in some situations, this can also be interpreted in terms of correlations between successive variables). From a theoretical point of view, we establish variable selection consistency results and show that {βQuad} achieves a Sparsity Inequality, i.e., a bound in terms of the number of non-zero components of the 'true' regression vector. These results are provided under a weaker assumption on the Gram matrix than the one used by the Lasso. In some situations this guarantees a significant improvement over the Lasso. Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted and shows that the {S-Lasso} β 
                        {SL} performs better than known methods as the Lasso, the {Elastic-Net} β 
                        {EN}, and the {Fused-Lasso} (introduced in. [30]) with respect to the estimation accuracy. This is especially the case when the regression vector is 'smooth', i.e., when the variations between successive coefficients of the unknown parameter of the regression are small. The study also reveals that the theoretical calibration of the tuning parameters and the one based on 10 fold cross validation imply two {S-Lasso} solutions with close performance.},

We approximate the matrix X as {circumflexX} = {sigma(k=1)(K)} {d(k)u(k)v(k)(T)}, where d(k), u(k), and v(k) minimize the squared Frobenius norm of X - {circumflexX}, subject to penalties on u(k) and v(k). This results in a regularized version of the singular value decomposition. Of particular interest is the use of L(1)-penalties on u(k) and v(k), which yields a decomposition of X using sparse vectors. We show that when the {PMD} is applied using an L(1)-penalty on v(k) but not on u(k), a method for sparse principal components results. In fact, this yields an efficient algorithm for the {"SCoTLASS"} proposal {(Jolliffe} and others 2003) for obtaining sparse principal components. This method is demonstrated on a publicly available gene expression data set. We also establish connections between the {SCoTLASS} method for sparse principal component analysis and the method of Zou and others (2006). In addition, we show that when the {PMD} is applied to a cross-products matrix, it results in a method for penalized canonical correlation analysis {(CCA).} We apply this penalized {CCA} method to simulated data and to a genomic data set consisting of gene expression and {DNA} copy number measurements on the same set of samples.},

	abstract = {Antisense agents are valuable tools to inhibit the expression of a target gene in a sequence-specific manner, and may be used for functional genomics, target validation and therapeutic purposes. Three types of {anti-mRNA} strategies can be distinguished. Firstly, the use of single stranded antisense-oligonucleotides; secondly, the triggering of {RNA} cleavage through catalytically active oligonucleotides referred to as ribozymes; and thirdly, {RNA} interference induced by small interfering {RNA} molecules. Despite the seemingly simple idea to reduce translation by oligonucleotides complementary to an {mRNA}, several problems have to be overcome for successful application. Accessible sites of the target {RNA} for oligonucleotide binding have to be identified, antisense agents have to be protected against nucleolytic attack, and their cellular uptake and correct intracellular localization have to be achieved. Major disadvantages of commonly used phosphorothioate {DNA} oligonucleotides are their low affinity towards target {RNA} molecules and their toxic side-effects. Some of these problems have been solved in ‘second generation’ nucleotides with alkyl modifications at the 2′ position of the ribose. In recent years valuable progress has been achieved through the development of novel chemically modified nucleotides with improved properties such as enhanced serum stability, higher target affinity and low toxicity. In addition, {RNA-cleaving} ribozymes and deoxyribozymes, and the use of 21-mer double-stranded {RNA} molecules for {RNA} interference applications in mammalian cells offer highly efficient strategies to suppress the expression of a specific gene.},

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional {(2-D)} recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of {2-D} characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as ''eigenfaces,'' because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture.},

	abstract = {We propose a framework for the extraction of biomarkers from low-dimensional manifolds representing inter-subject brain variation. Manifold coordinates of each image capture information about structural shape and appearance and, when a phenotype exists, about the subject's clinical state. Our framework incorporates subject meta-information into the manifold learning step. Apart from gender and age, information such as genotype or a derived biomarker is often available in clinical studies and can inform the classification of a query subject. Such information, whether discrete or continuous, is used as an additional input to manifold learning, extending the Laplacian Eigenmap objective function and enriching a similarity measure derived from pairwise image similarities. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven in contrast to a priori defined biomarkers derived from, e.g., manual or automated segmentations. They form a unified representation of both the imaging and non-imaging measurements, providing a natural use for data analysis and visualization. We test the method to classify subjects with Alzheimer's Disease {(AD)}, mild cognitive impairment {(MCI)} and healthy controls enrolled in the {ADNI} study. Non-imaging metadata used are {ApoE} genotype, a risk factor associated with {AD}, and the {CSF-concentration} of Aβ

Endoscopic biopsy specimens were taken from two locations (terminal ileum and colon) for histological examination and {RNA} extraction. We quantitatively measured the {mRNA} expression of 15 {SLC} transporters in 107 {IBD} patients (53 with Crohn's disease and 54 with ulcerative colitis) and 23 control subjects. {mRNA} expression was evaluated using the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. We observed that in the ileum of {IBD} patients, {mRNA} levels for serotonin transporter, equilibrative nucleoside transporter {(ENT)} 1, {ENT2}, and organic anion-transporting polypeptide {(OATP)} {2B1} were significantly elevated, whereas levels for apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter {(ASBT)} and organic zwitterion/cation transporter {(OCTN)} 2 were significantly lower. In colon, {mRNA} levels for {ENT1}, {ENT2}, concentrative nucleoside transporter {(CNT)} 2, {OATP2B1}, and {OATP4A1} were significantly higher, whereas {mRNA} levels for {OCTN2} were significantly decreased. In inflamed colon of {IBD} patients the {mRNA} expression levels of {ENT1}, {ENT2}, {CNT2}, {OATP2B1}, {OATP4A1}, and peptide transporter 1 were significantly higher.

	abstract = {Aim
To compare the diagnostic utility of pelvic ultrasound {(US)} and magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} on the clinical decision to proceed with uterine artery embolization {(UAE).}
Materials and methods
Over 2 years, 180 consecutive women (mean age 43) sought consultation for {UAE}, 116 underwent pelvic {US} and {MRI} before possible {UAE.} {US} was performed prior to {MRI.} Imaging was analysed for leiomyoma quantity, size and location, uterine volume, and the presence of potential contraindications to {UAE.} Discrepancies between imaging methods and cases where discrepancies could have altered management, were recorded.
Results
For the 116 patients who completed imaging, the average uterine volume was 701\&\#xa0;cm3 using {MRI} versus 658\&\#xa0;cm3 using {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.48). The average dominant leiomyoma volume was 292\&\#xa0;cm3 using {MRI} versus 253\&\#xa0;cm3 using {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.16). In 14 (12.1\%) patients {US} did not correctly quantify or localize leiomyomas compared with {MRI} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.0005). Thirteen patients did not undergo {UAE} (patient preference n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;9, pre-procedural imaging findings n\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;4). In the four cases where {UAE} was not performed due to imaging findings, relevant findings were all diagnosed by {MRI} compared with two by {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;0.5). The two cases not detected by ultrasound were adenomyosis and a pedunculate subserosal leiomyoma. Of the 103 patients who underwent {UAE}, 14 were treated (without complication) despite the presence of a relative contraindication; all 14 relative contraindications were identified by {MRI} compared with 13 by {US} (p\&\#xa0;=\&\#xa0;1.0).
Conclusion
{MRI} is more accurate than {US} for characterizing uterine leiomyomas. In a small but statistically insignificant number of cases, {MRI} identified findings that were missed by {US}, which changed management. For patients that are unsuitable to be assessed with {MRI}, ultrasound alone is sufficient for {pre-UAE} assessment.},

	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging allows researchers and clinicians to identify individual white matter fiber tracts and map their trajectories. The reliability and interpretability of fiber-tracking procedures is improved when a priori anatomical information is used as a guide. We have developed an automated method for labeling white matter fiber tracts in individual subjects based on a probabilistic atlas of fiber tract locations and orientations. The probabilistic fiber atlas contains 23 fiber tracts and was constructed by manually identifying fiber tracts in 21 healthy controls and 21 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy {(TLE).} The manual tract identification method required ∼40 h of manual editing by a trained image analyst using multiple regions of interest to select or exclude streamline fibers. Identification of fiber tracts with the atlas does not require human intervention, but nonetheless benefits from the a priori anatomical information that was used to manually identify the tracts included in the atlas. We applied this method to compare fractional anisotropy—thought to be a measure of white matter integrity—in individual fiber tracts between control subjects and patients with {TLE.} We found that the atlas-based and manual fiber selection methods produced a similar pattern of results. However, the between-group effect sizes using the atlas-derived fibers were generally as large or larger than those obtained with manually selected fiber tracks.

An adaptive mean-shift methodology is utilized in order to classify brain voxels into one of three main tissue types: gray matter, white matter, and cerebro-spinal fluid. The {MRI} image space is represented by a high-dimensional feature space that includes multimodal intensity features as well as spatial features. An adaptive mean-shift algorithm clusters the joint spatial-intensity feature space, thus extracting a representative set of high-density points within the feature space, otherwise known as modes. Tissue segmentation is obtained by a follow-up phase of intensity-based mode clustering into the three tissue categories. By its nonparametric nature, adaptive mean-shift can deal successfully with nonconvex clusters and produce convergence modes that are better candidates for intensity based classification than the initial voxels. The proposed method is validated on {3-D} single and multimodal datasets, for both simulated and real {MRI} data. It is shown to perform well in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods without the use of a preregistered statistical brain atlas.},

When there are several competing models the {MAICE} is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of {AIC} defined by {AIC} = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). {MAICE} provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of {MAICE} in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

Furthermore, the use of a common template eliminates the need for tractography segmentation and defines intersubject shape correspondence.

	abstract = {The remarkable antiquity, diversity, and significance in the ecology and evolution of Cetartiodactyla have inspired numerous attempts to resolve their phylogenetic relationships. However, previous analyses based on limited samples of nuclear genes or mitochondrial {DNA} sequences have generated results that were either inconsistent with one another, weakly supported, or highly sensitive to analytical conditions. Here, we present strongly supported results based upon over 1.4 Mb of an aligned {DNA} sequence matrix from 110 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes of 21 Cetartiodactyla species, which represent major Cetartiodactyla lineages, and three species of Perissodactyla and Carnivora as outgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of this newly developed genomic sequence data using a codon-based model and recently developed models of the rate autocorrelation resolved the phylogenetic relationships of the major cetartiodactylan lineages and of those lineages with a high degree of confidence. Cetacea was found to nest within Artiodactyla as the sister group of Hippopotamidae, and Tylopoda was corroborated as the sole base clade of Cetartiodactyla. Within Cetacea, the monophyletic status of Odontoceti relative to Mysticeti, the basal position of Physeteroidea in Odontoceti, the non-monophyly of the river dolphins, and the sister relationship between Delphinidae and {Monodontidae+Phocoenidae} were strongly supported. In particular, the groups of Tursiops (bottlenose dolphins) and Stenella (spotted dolphins) were validated as unnatural groups. Additionally, a very narrow time frame of ∼3 My (million years) was found for the rapid diversification of delphinids in the late Miocene, which made it difficult to resolve the phylogenetic relationships within the Delphinidae, especially for previous studies with limited data sets. The present study provides a statistically well-supported phylogenetic framework of Cetartiodactyla, which represents an important step toward ending some of the often-heated, century-long debate on their evolution.},

	abstract = {Therapeutic development in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis {(ALS)} is hampered by the lack of suitable biomarkers that might be sensitive to spatial and temporal patterns of neurodegeneration. Diffusion tensor imaging is a useful non-invasive tool that permits detection of microstructural tissue changes due, for example, to neurodegeneration. Even though the spinal cord bears the brunt of the disease process, diffusion tensor imaging has mainly been used to study white matter changes in the brain. The aim of this study was to examine the diffusion tensor imaging parameters of the cervical spinal cord {(C1} through C6 segments) and brainstem (corticospinal tracts in the pyramids and pons) among {ALS} patients, to compare these to findings in age-matched healthy controls, and to correlate these differences with clinical measures of disease severity. Fractional anisotropy in the white matter of the cervical cord was 12\% lower (p{\textless}0.01) in {ALS} patients (n=14) compared to age-matched healthy control subjects (n=15), and showed significant positive correlation with the average finger and foot tapping speed (r=0.61, p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients. Radial diffusivity in the cervical cord was 15\% higher (p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients compared to healthy control subjects. Radial diffusivity in the white matter of the cervical cord was significantly correlated with clinical measures of disease severity such as forced vital capacity {(FVC} \% predicted, r=-0.69, p{\textless}0.01), average finger and foot tapping speed from all four limbs (r=-0.59, p{\textless}0.05), and {ALSFRS-R} (r=-0.55, p{\textless}0.05) in {ALS} patients. There were no significant differences in mean diffusivity or axial diffusivity in the cervical spinal cord, or in any diffusion tensor imaging parameters measured in the brainstem. Analysis of diffusion tensor imaging parameters from individual cervical segments as well as profile plots along the length of the cervical cord showed larger differences in fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity at more distal cervical segments, providing evidence that supports the "dying-back" hypothesis of neurodegeneration in {ALS.}},

In this paper we develop a robust and versatile nonparametric clustering algorithm that is able to handle the unbalanced and highly irregular clusters encountered in such {CBIR} applications. The strength of our approach lies not so much in the clustering itself, but rather in the definition and use of two cluster-validity indices that are independent of the cluster topology. By combining them, an optimal clustering can be identified, and experiments confirm that the associated clusters do, indeed, correspond to perceptually salient image regions.},

The goal is to transform very high-dimensional input (typically, millions of voxels) to a low-dimensional representation (small number of constructed features) that preserves discriminative signal and is clinically interpretable. We formulate the task as a constrained optimization problem that combines generative and discriminative objectives and show how to extend it to the semi-supervised learning {(SSL)} setting. We propose a novel large-scale algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem. In the fully supervised case, we demonstrate accuracy rates that are better than or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets while producing a representation of the group difference that is consistent with prior clinical reports. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for {SSL} is evaluated with both benchmark and medical imaging datasets. In the benchmark datasets, the results are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods for {SSL.} For evaluation of the {SSL} setting in medical datasets, we use images of subjects with mild cognitive impairment {(MCI)}, which is believed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease {(AD)}, as unlabeled data. {AD} subjects and normal control {(NC)} subjects are used as labeled data, and we try to predict conversion from {MCI} to {AD} on follow-up. The semi-supervised extension of this method not only improves the generalization accuracy for the labeled data {(AD/NC)} slightly but is also able to predict subjects which are likely to converge to {AD.} © 2011 {IEEE.}},

The complex and often subtle and nonlinear ways in which various factors, such as age, sex, genotype and disease, can affect brain morphology, suggest that alternative, unbiased methods based on statistical learning theory might be able to better quantify brain changes that are due to a variety of factors, especially when relationships between brain networks, rather than individual structures, and disease are examined.},

	volume = {8},
	abstract = {In recent work, several authors have introduced methods for sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse {CCA).} Suppose that two sets of measurements are available on the same set of observations. Sparse {CCA} is a method for identifying sparse linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are highly correlated with each other. It has been shown to be useful in the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data, when two sets of assays are available on the same set of samples. In this paper, we propose two extensions to the sparse {CCA} methodology. (1) Sparse {CCA} is an unsupervised method; that is, it does not make use of outcome measurements that may be available for each observation (e.g., survival time or cancer subtype). We propose an extension to sparse {CCA}, which we call sparse supervised {CCA}, which results in the identification of linear combinations of the two sets of variables that are correlated with each other and associated with the outcome. (2) It is becoming increasingly common for researchers to collect data on more than two assays on the same set of samples; for instance, {SNP}, gene expression, and {DNA} copy number measurements may all be available. We develop sparse multiple {CCA} in order to extend the sparse {CCA} methodology to the case of more than two data sets. We demonstrate these new methods on simulated data and on a recently published and publicly available diffuse large B-cell lymphoma data set. Copyright © 2009 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

Accurate diagnosis of {aMCI} would enable earlier treatment, and could thus help minimize the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a magnetic resonance imaging-based automated classification schema for identifying {aMCI.} This was carried out in a sample of community-dwelling adults aged 70-90years old: 79 with a clinical diagnosis of {aMCI} and 204 who were cognitively normal. Our schema was novel in using measures of both spatial atrophy, derived from T1-weighted images, and white matter alterations, assessed with diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} tract-based spatial statistics {(TBSS).} Subcortical volumetric features were extracted using a {FreeSurfer-initialized} Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping {(FS+LDDMM)} segmentation approach, and fractional anisotropy {(FA)} values obtained for white matter regions of interest. Features were ranked by their ability to discriminate between {aMCI} and normal cognition, and a support vector machine {(SVM)} selected an optimal feature subset that was used to train {SVM} classifiers. As evaluated via 10-fold cross-validation, the classification performance characteristics achieved by our schema were: accuracy, 71.09\%; sensitivity, 51.96\%; specificity, 78.40\%; and area under the curve, 0.7003. Additionally, we identified numerous socio-demographic, lifestyle, health and other factors potentially implicated in the misclassification of individuals by our schema and those previously used by others. Given its high level of performance, our classification schema could facilitate the early detection of {aMCI} in community-dwelling elderly adults.},

	abstract = {Background: Abnormal white matter development may disrupt integration within neural circuits, causing particular impairments in higher-order behaviours. In autism spectrum disorders {(ASDs)}, white matter alterations may contribute to characteristic deficits in complex socio-emotional and communication domains. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} and tract based spatial statistics {(TBSS)} to evaluate white matter microstructure in {ASD.} {Methods/Principal} Findings: {DTI} scans were acquired for 19 children and adolescents with {ASD} ({\textasciitilde}8-18 years; mean 12.4±3.1) and 16 age and {IQ} matched controls ({\textasciitilde}8-18 years; mean 12.3±3.6) on a {3T} {MRI} system. {DTI} values for fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity, were measured. Age by group interactions for global and voxel-wise white matter indices were examined. Voxel-wise analyses comparing {ASD} with controls in: (i) the full cohort (ii), children only (≤12 yrs.), and (iii) adolescents only ({\textgreater}12 yrs.) were performed, followed by tract-specific comparisons. Significant age-by-group interactions on global {DTI} indices were found for all three diffusivity measures, but not for fractional anisotropy. Voxel-wise analyses revealed prominent diffusion measure differences in {ASD} children but not adolescents, when compared to healthy controls. Widespread increases in mean and radial diffusivity in {ASD} children were prominent in frontal white matter voxels. Follow-up tract-specific analyses highlighted disruption to pathways integrating frontal, temporal, and occipital structures involved in socio-emotional processing. {Conclusions/Significance:} Our findings highlight disruption of neural circuitry in {ASD}, particularly in those white matter tracts that integrate the complex socio-emotional processing that is impaired in this disorder. © 2011 Ameis et al.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a general and unifying optimization framework for the problem of feature extraction and reduction for high-dimensional pattern classification of medical images. Feature extraction is often an ad hoc and case-specific task. Herein, we formulate it as a problem of sparse decomposition of images into a basis that is desired to possess several properties: 1) Sparsity and local spatial support, which usually provides good generalization ability on new samples, and lends itself to anatomically intuitive interpretations; 2) good discrimination ability, so that projection of images onto the optimal basis yields discriminant features to be used in a machine learning paradigm; 3) spatial smoothness and contiguity of the estimated basis functions. Our method yields a parts-based representation, which warranties that the image is decomposed into a number of positive regional projections. A non-negative matrix factorization scheme is used, and a numerical solution with proven convergence is used for solution. Results in classification of Alzheimers patients from the {ADNI} study are presented.},

Here we show that cytochrome c binds to the {InsP(3)R} during apoptosis. Addition of 1 {nM} cytochrome c blocks calcium-dependent inhibition of {InsP(3)R} function. Early in apoptosis, cytochrome c translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum where it selectively binds {InsP(3)R}, resulting in sustained, oscillatory cytosolic calcium increases. These calcium events are linked to the coordinate release of cytochrome c from all mitochondria. Our findings identify a feed-forward mechanism whereby early cytochrome c release increases {InsP(3)R} function, resulting in augmented cytochrome c release that amplifies the apoptotic signal.},

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

	abstract = {Objective:
To test the hypothesis that different neurocognitive networks underlie verbal fluency deficits in frontotemporal lobar degeneration {(FTLD).}

Methods:
Letter {(“FAS”)} and semantic (“animal”) fluency tests were administered to patients with a behavioral/dysexecutive disorder {(bvFTLD;} n = 71), semantic dementia {(SemD;} n = 21), and progressive nonfluent aphasia {(PNFA;} n = 26). Tests measuring working memory, naming/lexical retrieval, and semantic knowledge were also obtained. {MRI} voxel-based morphometry {(VBM)} studies were obtained on a subset of these patients {(bvFTLD}, n = 51; {PNFA}, n = 11; {SemD}, n = 10).

Results:
Patients with {SemD} were disproportionately impaired on the semantic fluency measure. Reduced output on this test was correlated with impaired performance on naming/lexical retrieval tests. {VBM} analyses related reduced letter and semantic fluency to anterior and inferior left temporal lobe atrophy. Patients with {bvFTLD} were equally impaired on both fluency tests. Poor performance on both fluency tests was correlated with low scores on working memory and naming/lexical retrieval measures. In this group, {MRI-VBM} analyses related letter fluency to bilateral frontal atrophy and semantic fluency to left frontal/temporal atrophy. Patients with {PNFA} were also equally impaired on fluency tests. Reduced semantic fluency output was correlated with reduced performance on naming/lexical retrieval tests. {MRI-VBM} analyses related semantic fluency to the right frontal lobe and letter fluency to left temporal atrophy.

Conclusions:
Distinct neurocognitive networks underlie impaired performance on letter and semantic fluency tests in frontotemporal lobar degeneration subgroups.

We studied the cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations by classic cytogenetics, polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, with special emphasis on t(14;18), affecting bcl-2, and 3q27 rearrangement, affecting bcl-6, in 32 cases of {FL} grade {3B.} Three distinctive subgroups were identified based upon the existence of breakpoint 3q27, a translocation t(14;18), or the absence of both. Group I involved a t(14;18) and no 3q27 aberrations (n = 13); group {II} was without a t(14;18) and without 3q27 aberrations (n = 9), but had other cytogenetic aberrations; and group {III} was without a t(14;18) but with aberrations involving 3q27 (n = 10). None of the {FL} grade {3B} cases harbored both a t(14;18) and 3q27 aberration. These results, in particular the finding of a mutual exclusiveness of bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangement, indicate at least 3 different pathways of oncogenesis in {FL} grade {3B.} {FL} grade {3B} with bcl-2 rearrangement probably is part of the same entity as the other follicular lymphomas (1, 2, {3A)}, whereas the cases with 3q27 abnormalities or other unrelated translocations are more closely related to the majority of diffuse large-cell lymphomas of germinal center cell origin.},

For the case of spatially varying mixtures of Gaussian density functions with unknown means and variances, an expectation-maximization {(EM)} algorithm is derived for maximum likelihood estimation of the pixel labels and the parameters of the mixture densities, An a priori density function is formulated for the spatially variant mixture weights. A generalized {EM} algorithm for maximum a posteriori estimation of the pixel labels based upon these prior densities is derived. This algorithm incorporates a variation of gradient projection in the maximization step and the resulting algorithm takes the form of grouped coordinate ascent. Gaussian densities have been used for simplicity, but the algorithm can easily be modified to incorporate other appropriate models for the mixture model component densities. The accuracy of the algorithm is quantitatively evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation, and its performance is qualitatively assessed via experimental images from computerized tomography {(CT)} and magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI).}},

Little is known about the neurological effects of blast-related {mTBI} and whether they differ from those of civilian, non-blast {mTBI.} Given that brain damage from blasts may be diffuse and heterogeneous, we tested the hypothesis that blast {mTBI} is associated with subtle white matter disruptions in the brain that are spatially inconsistent across individuals. We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine white matter integrity, as quantified by fractional anisotropy {(FA)}, in a group of American military service members with (n=25) or without (n=33) blast-related {mTBI} who had been deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. History of civilian non-blast {mTBI} was equally common across groups, which enabled testing of both blast and non-blast {mTBI} effects on measures sensitive to (1) concentrated, spatially consistent (average {FA} within a region of interest {[ROI])}, (2) concentrated, spatially variable (number of {ROIs} with low average {FA)}, and (3) diffuse (number of voxels with low {FA)} disruptions of white matter integrity. Blast {mTBI} was associated with a diffuse, global pattern of lower white matter integrity, and this pattern was not affected by previous civilian {mTBI.} Neither type of {mTBI} had an effect on the measures sensitive to more concentrated and spatially consistent white matter disruptions. Additionally, individuals with more than one blast {mTBI} tended to have a larger number of low {FA} voxels than individuals with a single blast injury. These results indicate that blast {mTBI} is associated with disrupted integrity of several white matter tracts, and that these disruptions are diluted by averaging across the large number of voxels within an {ROI.} The reported pattern of effects supports the conclusion that the neurological effects of blast {mTBI} are diffuse, widespread, and spatially variable.},

	abstract = {Huntington's disease {(HD)} is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder that is currently untreatable. A prominent feature of {HD} pathology is the reduction of the pro-survival neurotrophin {Brain-Derived} Neurotrophic Factor {(BDNF).} Both {mRNA} and protein levels of {BDNF} are decreased in the brains of several {HD} rodent models and in human {HD} patients. We now report for the first time that this molecular event is mirrored in blood from {HD} rodent models. While protein levels of {BDNF} are undetectable in mouse blood, {mRNA} levels are measurable and diminish during {HD} progression in transgenic mouse {(R6/2)} and rat models of {HD.} Among the eight different {BDNF} transcripts, only {BDNF} exon {III} is transcribed in mouse blood and its expression is progressively compromised in R6/2 mice with respect to age-matched wild-types. Assessment of {BDNF} {mRNA} in {HD} rat blood shows a similar result, which is reinforced by evidence that protein levels of the neurotrophin are also significantly reduced at a symptomatic stage. Finally, we demonstrate that acute and chronic treatment of R6/2 mice with {CEP-1347}, a mixed lineage kinase {(MLK)} inhibitor with neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects, leads to increased total {BDNF} {mRNA} in blood when compared to untreated R6/2 mice. Our results indicate that alterations in {BDNF} {mRNA} levels in peripheral blood are a readily accessible measurement of disease progression and drug efficacy in {HD} rodent models.},

	abstract = {Analysis of previously published sets of {DNA} microarray gene expression data by singular value decomposition has uncovered underlying patterns or 'characteristic modes' in their temporal profiles. These patterns contribute unequally to the structure of the expression profiles. Moreover, the essential features of a given set of expression profiles are captured using just a small number of characteristic modes. This leads to the striking conclusion that the transcriptional response of a genome is orchestrated in a few fundamental patterns of gene expression change. These patterns are both simple and robust, dominating the alterations in expression of genes throughout the genome. Moreover, the characteristic modes of gene expression change in response to environmental perturbations are similar in such distant organisms as yeast and human cells. This analysis reveals simple regularities in the seemingly complex transcriptional transitions of diverse cells to new states, and these provide insights into the operation of the underlying genetic networks.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

New preclinical Alzheimer disease {(AD)} diagnostic criteria have been developed using biomarkers in cognitively normal {(CN)} adults. We implemented these criteria using an {MRI} biomarker previously associated with {AD} dementia, testing the hypothesis that individuals at high risk for preclinical {AD} would be at elevated risk for cognitive decline.


{METHODS}

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database was interrogated for {CN} individuals. {MRI} data were processed using a published set of a priori regions of interest to derive a single measure known as the {AD} signature {(ADsig).} Each individual was classified as {ADsig-low} (≥ 1 {SD} below the mean: high risk for preclinical {AD)}, {ADsig-average} (within 1 {SD} of mean), or {ADsig-high} (≥ 1 {SD} above mean). A 3-year cognitive decline outcome was defined a priori using change in Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes and selected neuropsychological measures.


{RESULTS}

Individuals at high risk for preclinical {AD} were more likely to experience cognitive decline, which developed in 21\% compared with 7\% of {ADsig-average} and 0\% of {ADsig-high} groups (p = 0.03). Logistic regression demonstrated that every 1 {SD} of cortical thinning was associated with a nearly tripled risk of cognitive decline (p = 0.02). Of those for whom baseline {CSF} data were available, 60\% of the high risk for preclinical {AD} group had {CSF} characteristics consistent with {AD} while 36\% of the {ADsig-average} and 19\% of the {ADsig-high} groups had such {CSF} characteristics (p = 0.1).


{CONCLUSIONS}

This approach to the detection of individuals at high risk for preclinical {AD-identified} in single {CN} individuals using this quantitative {ADsig} {MRI} biomarker-may provide investigators with a population enriched for {AD} pathobiology and with a relatively high likelihood of imminent cognitive decline consistent with prodromal {AD.}},

	volume = {32},
	abstract = {The purpose of model selection algorithms such as All Subsets, Forward Selection and Backward Elimination is to choose a linear model on the basis of the same set of data to which the model will be applied. Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression {(LARS)}, a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the {LARS} algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the {LARS} modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different {LARS} modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler {LARS} algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a {LARS} estimate is available, from which we derive a C 
                        p estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible {LARS} estimates. {LARS} and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2004.},

We apply the {SCCA} model to a dataset that includes 23 control subjects that are demographically matched to 49 subjects with autopsy or {CSF-biomarker-diagnosed} {AD} (n=24) and {FTD} (n=25) with both {DTI} and T1-weighted structural imaging. {SCCA} shows that the {FTD-related} frontal and temporal degeneration pattern is correlated across modalities with permutation corrected p{\textless}0.0005. In {AD}, we find significant association between cortical thinning and reduction in white matter integrity within a distributed parietal and temporal network (p{\textless}0.0005). Furthermore, we show that-within {SCCA} identified regions-significant differences exist between {FTD} and {AD} cortical-connective degeneration patterns. We validate these distinct, multimodal imaging patterns by showing unique relationships with cognitive measures in {AD} and {FTD.} We conclude that {SCCA} is a potentially valuable approach in image analysis that can be applied productively to distinguishing between neurodegenerative conditions.},

Typical fuzzy-segmentation schemes, e.g., those based on fuzzy C means {(FCM)}, incorporate Gaussian class models that are inherently biased towards ellipsoidal clusters characterized by a mean element and a covariance matrix. Tensors in fiber bundles, however, inherently lie on specific manifolds in Riemannian spaces. Unlike {FCM-based} schemes, the proposed method represents these manifolds using nonparametric data-driven statistical models. The paper describes a statistically-sound (consistent) technique for nonparametric modeling in Riemannian {DT} spaces. The proposed method produces an optimal fuzzy segmentation by maximizing a novel information-theoretic energy in a Markov-random-field framework. Results on synthetic and real, {DT} and {MR} images, show that the proposed method provides information about the uncertainties in the segmentation decisions, which stem from imaging artifacts including noise, partial voluming, and inhomogeneity. By enhancing the nonparametric model to capture the spatial continuity and structure of the fiber bundle, we exploit the framework to extract the cingulum fiber bundle. Typical tractography methods for tract delineation, incorporating thresholds on fractional anisotropy and fiber curvature to terminate tracking, can face serious problems arising from partial voluming and noise. For these reasons, tractography often fails to extract thin tracts with sharp changes in orientation, such as the cingulum. The results demonstrate that the proposed method extracts this structure significantly more accurately as compared to tractography.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
